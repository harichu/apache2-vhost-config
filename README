 Usage:

 * mkvhost.sh - making virtual host.

   Upon running, mkvhost.sh will:

   * create vhost directories and all conf files.
   * Set up two virtual hosts "shortname" and "shortname-redirect". The later
     one is good for blind redirection, e.g. www.domain.tld -> domain.tld.
   * Set up logrotate, awstat and their corntab.

 * rmvhost.sh - remove conf file symbolic links of the vhost created by
   mkvhost.sh.

   After running, to permentently delete the virtual host, do 'rm -R ./vhost/'

 * lnvhost.sh - recreate links.

 * config

    **Experimental** Setup LAMP enviroment on a bare Ubuntu system.

 ====

  Known issue:

  * apache2 package changed virtual host setting from <VirtualHost *> to
    <VirtualHost *:80> after version 2.2.9-8. Do modify mkvhost.sh accordingly
    BEFORE creating virtual hosts.
